          Black Hole is a platformer I made 3 years ago, the idea was pretty straight forward you are a black hole that can absorb light. Your goal is to get from point A to point B while collecting light, collectibles and not dying in the process. The thing about 2D platformers is it was the most competitive genre to break into 3 years ago and it is even harder to do that today. Because of this to get your game noticed you have to have a nearly perfect game, that has tight controls, a great mechanic, artstyle and fun gameplay.
          </p>

        <section id="Methods">
          <h1 class="sectionTitle">Methods</h1>
          <p class="sectionParagraph">
          Firstly I need to find out what is inherently wrong with my game what is broken, what needs tweaking and what is unfair. When your player fails you never want it to be due to something that they had no control over, whether it was a jump that didn't register or a mechanic that doesn't quite make sense.
          </br>
          </br>
          To find these flaws I need experts to do a Heuristic Evaluation of my game, find the strenghts and weaknesses. So I can see what needs to be fixed. Then when I have the flaws of the game I need to get input from players who know the flaws of the game, then they can tell me how they would prefer them to be fixed. I will do this by doing a Qualitative Interview. After knowing where to take my game I need to where the current market stands, what is popular, how people play 2d platformers and who plays them. To acomplish this I will create a Quantitative Questionnaire that will help me know where to pivot my game so it is relevant to the current market.

        <section id="Results">
          <h1 class="sectionTitle">Results</h1>
          <h2 class="sectionSubTitle">Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
          <p class="sectionParagraph">
          For the Heuristics Evaluation I got 4 experts with 2d platforming and game design experience, from the Games Academy, to play my game until they were satisfied that they have found all the flaws with the game by playing through it once then filling out the Heuristics Evaluation form provided, and playing it again with the Heuristics in mind. 
          </p><h3>Strenghts of the game</h3>
          <p class="sectionParagraph">
          The experts found the game to be fun because of the quick respawns, making death not being a punishment. They liked the artstyle, saying it was consistent through out the game. And they enjoyed the light mechanic when they understood how it worked.
          </p>
          <h3>Weaknesses of the game</h3>
          <p class="sectionParagraph">
          The main flaw all the experts brought up was there was no tutorial to teach you the controls and the game mechanics so they encountered streches of game where they were progressing through the level purely on trial and error clicking buttons and not knowing what to expect. Then moving on to the controls some experts said the controls felt floaty and a little too fast. Also the double jump should be completely changed, because the jumping is based on physics causing way too much variation in jumps. 
          </p>
		<h3>Observations</h3>
          <p class="sectionParagraph">
          While the experts where playing I observed their patterns and a common theme was that they were jumping a little bit late, so adding a jump lienency that allows you to jump a few miliseconds after the jump would tighten the controls more. Also some of the people expected the double jump to remain after the level where the mechanic was tested, so there needs to be extra explanation on how the mechanic works.
          </p>
          <h2 class="sectionSubTitle">Qualitative Interview</h2>
          <p class="sectionParagraph">
          After doing the Heuristic Evaluation I found that the players where not getting far enough in the game, because there were no explanations on how some of the mechanics worked. So going into the Qualitative Interview I challanged the players to get as far in the game as they can in 2 minutes, after I gave them detailed instuctions on how every mechanic in the game works. This way I can simulate how well would a player do had he would have went through a tutorial. And after they finish the 2 minute run I would also get better information on what works and what is completely unnoticable in the game, things like the story being told.
          </p>
          <h3>Qualitative Interview Results/Observations</h3>
          <p class="sectionParagraph">
          Players who didnt get past level 4, found the values for the controls need to be tweaked. But players who did found that there was an immediate difficulty spike out of nowhere.
          <br>
          What suprised me was that all the interviewees when asked "Is story important to you in a 2d platformer?" said it is not important at all. When making I spent a fair amount of time thinking of the story and how it should play out, so going forward I should focus my resources on other aspects of the game.
          <br>
          When asked "What should collectibles do in a platforming game?" two people answered that collectibles should give you an advantage going forward, in the game something like an extra life, or a higher jump.
          <br>
          Four out of Five people said they expect to see a boss battle at the end of the stage.
          <br>
          And the most interesting thing I found by doing this Interview was that people who did worse at the game were more in the know about current generation platformers, they are used to great controls which they are not getting out of my game, So I should look at the games they provided and try to get the controls similar to those.
          </p>
          <h2 class="sectionSubTitle">Quantitative Questionnaire</h3>
          <p class="sectionParagraph">
          After knowing where players want the game to go, I need to find out in what state the current 2d platforming market is at and I acomplish this by handing out a Quantitative Questionnaire to gaming communities and forums online. Things like price trends, their platforming preferances, what platformer is their favorite to establish their experience.
          </p>
           <h3>Price of the game</h3>

            <p class="sectionParagraph">
              I was surprised by the high amount of players that would buy games between 11-20 pounds. To I atributed this to players who pay more for games have played more of that genre this year but there is a low positive correlation between hours of platformers played this year and the price they were willing to pay with. So from this I can get an idea on how to price my game.
          </p>
          <h3>Difficulity</h3>
          <iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTk-GNvK_O8Cex_RU29fcy2YSoVBPej-8b-6per2VCooxskFoa-eWbC15unA8tOmuwZO7hTUjvW-bH2/pubchart?oid=873963732&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
          <p class="sectionParagraph">
          There is a low positive correlation between people who do everything in a game and people who often play difficult games, so having collectible items in my game is justified as long as I do not over do it, and they have a purpose.
          </p>
          <h3>Unique mechanic</h3>
          <iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTk-GNvK_O8Cex_RU29fcy2YSoVBPej-8b-6per2VCooxskFoa-eWbC15unA8tOmuwZO7hTUjvW-bH2/pubchart?oid=1176711122&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
          <p class="sectionParagraph">
          There was no to extemely low correlation between people who have spent a lot of time playing platformers this year and people who consider a unique mechanic extremely important in a 2d platformer. Meaning I should focus more on other aspects of my game than forcing my own mechanics on the player.
          </p>
          <h3>Genre</h3>

          <p class="sectionParagraph">
         	While my linear platformer is the second most popular choise amongst gamers, amongst peoples favorite games and recently played games people prefer Metroidvania style games more, so I should consider pivoting my game to that.

          <p class="sectionParagraph">
          Combining every reasearch I now know I should pivot my game from a linear one to a Metroidvania, focus it purely on controller controls instead of using keyboard and mouse and release it on the PC platform, I should focus more time on level design and difficulity than on story and and unique mechanics. People will much rather pay for a game full price as long as it is a complete package game. Aiming for a game lenght of 5-10 hours I would fit into my target audiance better, without wasting their time.

          <h1 class="sectionTitle">Conclusion</h1>
          <p class="sectionParagraph">
         	In conclusion, my game was programmed around keyboard controls when the target audiance and the experts prefer to play with a controller no matter on what system they are playing the game on. Story is the last thing I should add to the game because it is not sought after in the platforming community. By doing the Qualitative Interview I got alot of feed back on what could be added to the game to improve its current flaws and adding collectibles that give you abilities is one of the key mechanics I can use to turn my game into a Metroidvania style game. Through Qualitative questions like "What is the last platforming game you played?" and "What is your favorite platforming game?" I was able to find a pattern that Metroidvania style games are more popular and people are willing to pay more money for them. Also people whos favorite game was old like mario, had not played any recent 2d platformers meaning they would not purchase my game anyways. Through Heuristic Evaluation I found that my controls need to be reworked and by toing the interviews and from the results of the Questionaire I now have a list of recent and relevant games to model my controls after.
